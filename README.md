# Portfolio Optimization - Problem Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to exercises from the book *Portfolio Optimization - Daniel P. Palomar*. The goal of this repository is to serve both as a study log and a reference for key concepts in quantitative finance and portfolio theory.

# Structure
Each chapter from the book has its own folder. Inside each folder, you will find:

- A summary of the chapterâ€™s core concepts (when applicable)
- Solved exercises in code (mainly `.ipynb` or `.py`)
- Exercise prompts (when available) for context

# Notes
- All solutions are written by me and reflect my understanding of the material.
- Some problems include a mix of mathematical reasoning, Python code (mainly with NumPy, pandas, PyPortfolioOpt, etc.), and discussion.
- I am not including full reproductions of copyrighted content. Only brief prompts or paraphrased problem descriptions.
